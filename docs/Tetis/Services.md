# Services

We will offer two different services in the PGTEC data space: a base model that everyone in the data space will be able to use and a advanced model where the users with specific privileges can select specific parameters and variations of the model.

## Base model

The base model will consist of forecast of river flows using predefined weather forecast of different meteorological agencies (AEMET, MeteoFrance, DWD).

## Advanced model

In the advanced services users will be able to run specific simulation altering different input parameters such as:

- Intensity factor of the weather forecast.
- Alter the direction of the prediction.
