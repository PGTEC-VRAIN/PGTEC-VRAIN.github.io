## Definition

The purpose of this section is to explain all the data flows that take place within the PGTEC ecosystem. Since the objective of the project is to create an interoperable data space in which climate data and services can be securely shared, the associated data flows play a key role.

For the development of the project, data flows have been classified according to the temporal nature of the climate data. Based on this criterion, two main groups have been defined:

- Meteorological prediction data flow: Includes all data flows from climate agencies that provide future or forecast data to the ecosystem.

- Real-time data flow: Includes climate agencies that provide real-time or near real-time climate data to the ecosystem.

This classification improves the clarity and understanding of the different data flows and facilitates a more detailed analysis of each one.

## Types

Each data flow comprises a set of climate agencies or institutions that provide climate data of particular relevance for the early prevention of climate-related emergencies. All climate agencies are therefore equally important, as all climate data, regardless of the data flow to which they belong, contribute to anticipating adverse meteorological phenomena.

The following subsections describe in detail the data flows introduced above. Defining structured and traceable data flows is essential to ensure timely access to data and to enable secure data sharing within the data space, preserving data integrity and supporting informed decision-making for the prevention of adverse events.

To explore the different data flows, navigate to the following sections:

- Dive into [Real Time Data Flow](./real_time_data_flow/index.md) to access the explanation of real-time data flows.
- Go to [Predictions Data Flow](./predictions_flow/index.md) to access the explanation of meteorological prediction data flows.
