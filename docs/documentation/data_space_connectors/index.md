A data space connector is a technical component that enables the secure and controlled exchange of data between organisations within a data space. It functions as a gateway that manages communication, authentication, and data usage policies. **Each participant deploys their own connector**, ensuring sovereignty over their data. Furthermore, it promotes interoperability by adhering to standards such as those set by IDSA or Gaia-X.

The most extended data space connector technology are:

    Simpl programme is an initiative that aims to create a data space connector **based on the Eclipse Data Space Components**. It is still in its early stages of development, but it aims to leverage the foundational strengths of Eclipse to provide a final product solution within the data space connector landscape in the EU.
