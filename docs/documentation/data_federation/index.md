title: Data Federation
---

A key aspect of data spaces is their interoperability, which essentially refers to the union of several independent data spaces under a common set of rules and protocols to enable data exchange. This federation allows data to be shared and accessed securely and efficiently among different organizations, while at the same time maintaining the sovereignty and control of the data by the entities that own them.

The federation arises in data spaces due to the need for collaboration and large-scale data sharing in today's digital world. The challenges associated with managing large volumes of data, protecting privacy and security, and the need to extract value from data have led to the creation of federated data spaces. These spaces allow organizations to work together to leverage data more effectively, while respecting regulations and the rights of data owners.
