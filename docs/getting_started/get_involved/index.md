CitCom.ai is a project **open to the European society, allowing any interested company or institution to join this ecosystem**. CitCom.ai's **core technology is data spaces**, which guarantee secure environments for data exchange.  

## What data are available?

CitCom.ai brings together a network of sites distributed across Europe ([Nodes & Countries](../nodes_countries.md)), each contributing data from distinct domains of smart cities — including mobility, power and connect. These datasets originate from a variety of stakeholders such as cities, research centers, and private entities.

To explore what’s currently available, we invite you to browse our data catalog, where you’ll find detailed descriptions and thematic classifications. If a dataset sparks your interest, you can reach out to its owner directly to request access. In many cases, data access can also be facilitated via our experimental data space layer, ensuring secure and standardized retrieval in compliance with European data-sharing protocols.

## How to join the Citcom.ai data space?

The process of joining an existing data space will be outlined, including details on membership requirements, access controls, and collaboration tools within that environment.  

In addition, access to a data space does not have to be only as a **consumer** of data, but you can also access it as a **provider**. Depending on the **role** you want to play in the data space, the way you join may vary. Basically, you **need to deploy a data space connector** and **request certified access** to the data space trust anchor manager.
