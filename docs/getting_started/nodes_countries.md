# Nodes & Countries

CitCom is organized as three "supernodes" Nordic, Central, and South, with satellites and sub-nodes located across 11 countries in the European Union: Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Spain, Poland, and Italy. 

- **Nordic Supernode** is focused on the theme "POWER." Nordic nodes work in areas that support smart cities and communities and focus on energy, environmental solutions, cyber security, ethics, and edge learning.
- **Central Supernode** revolves around the "MOVE" theme. The node focuses more specifically on challenges related to mobility and logistics in cities and communities.
- **Southern Supernode** revolves around the "CONNECT" theme. The supernode focuses more specifically on the need to securely connect citizens, infrastructures, AI, and robotics services in cities and communities. This theme and supernode will focus on innovations that provide intelligence to local infrastructures and city cross-sectoral services.

Supernodes serve as regional hubs that aggregate expertise, resources, and best practices, thereby providing strategic oversight and ensuring that the testing environments remain closely aligned with the unique challenges and opportunities of their respective regions.
