# MIMs Tools

List of tools and projects that can help services comply with OASC Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms.

## MIM1 - Context Information

| Tool | Features |
|-|-|
| [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/FIWARE/context.Orion-LD) | Orion is a widely adopted and mature context broker implementation developed by the FIWARE community. |
| [Scorpio Broker](https://github.com/ScorpioBroker/ScorpioBroker) | Scorpio Broker is another context broker implementation that conforms to the NGSI-LD standard. |
| [Djane.io](https://github.com/sensinov/djane) | Djane.io is an open-source context broker implementation that also supports the NGSI-LD standard. It aims to provide a flexible and extensible platform for managing context information |
| [Stellio Broker](https://github.com/stellio-hub/stellio-context-broker) | Stellio is a context broker implementation specifically designed for high-performance and large-scale deployments. |
| [Lepus](https://github.com/jason-fox/lepus) | An NGSI-LD wrapper for NGSI-v2 Context Brokers, which facilitates the transition or interoperability between both versions of the NGSI specification. |
| [QuantumLeap](https://github.com/orchestracities/ngsi-timeseries-api) | A FIWARE Generic Enabler to support the use of NGSIv2 (and NGSI-LD experimentally) data in time-series databases |
| [tutorials NGSI-LD](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.NGSI-LD) | Collection of tutorials for the FIWARE ecosystem designed for NGSI-LD developers. |
| [Orange-OpenSource/python-ngsild-client](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/python-ngsild-client) | A Python library dedicated to NGSI-LD, which serves both as an NGSI-LD API client and a toolbox for efficiently creating and manipulating NGSI-LD entities. |
| [OGC SensorThings API](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sensorthings/) | The OGC SensorThings API is a geospatially enabled framework that connects Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data, and applications via the web. This API facilitates interoperability and seamless integration within IoT ecosystems. |
| [ngsild-client](https://github.com/CitComAI-Hub/ngsild-client) | Python ngsi-ld client for UPV-CitCom.ai projects. |
| [A guide for connecting NGSI-V2 Broker to NGSI-LD via FIWARE IoT-Agent](https://github.com/CitComAI-Hub/IoTAgent.NGSI-V2_to_NGSI-LD_Subscription) | Local environment for testing subscriptions between FIWARE Orion brokers NGSI-V2 to NGSI-LD via FIWARE IoT-Agent. |


## MIM2 - Data Models

| Tool | Features |
|-|-|
| [Smart Data Models](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models) | An Umbrella Repository for collecting Data Models based on real world use-cases. |
| [pySmartDataModels](https://pypi.org/project/pysmartdatamodels/) | The pysmartdatamodels package provides a comprehensive collection of open-licensed, free data models suitable for digital twin implementations, data spaces, and smart application development. This Python package includes functions for utilizing these data models in development, ensuring compatibility and simplification in digital solutions creationâ€‹. |
| [SAREF (Smart Applications REFerence) ontology](https://saref.etsi.org/) | It is a consensus-based model designed to streamline the integration of smart applications by providing a set of modular building blocks. SAREF introduces core concepts, relationships, and axioms for the smart applications domain, emphasizing reuse, modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. |
| [DTDL](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/tree/master/DTDL/v3) | DTDL is based on JSON-LD and is programming-language independent. DTDL isn't exclusive to Azure Digital Twins. It is also used to represent device data in other IoT services such as IoT Plug and Play. |
