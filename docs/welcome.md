This site serves as a comprehensive **documentation hub for the CitCom.ai project**, focusing on offering the **Minimal Package** for [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEF)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities) nodes. The Minimal Package contains comprehensive guides, toolboxes, and deployment frameworks to **ensure interoperability** across the CitCom.ai wide range of TEF nodes by defining a **common reference architecture**. Based on this architecture, it also provides support and examples for developing **AI services**.

## About CitCom.ai
The [CitCom.ai](https://citcom.ai) project is an ambitious **European Union initiative** aimed at establishing a comprehensive [Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing-and-experimentation-facilities) for **AI and robotics**, tailored explicitly to **smart and sustainable cities and communities**. This project is designed to accelerate the adoption of AI technologies across Europe by providing real-world testing environments where companies can develop, test, and validate their AI-driven products and services. CitCom ensures that these technologies meet the latest EU regulations, including those related to data **privacy and cybersecurity** while supporting the creation of **interoperable** and ethically sound AI solutions. The project spans multiple countries, with over [30 participating organizations](https://citcom.ai/about), and it emphasizes a coordinated approach to fostering innovation that aligns with the EUâ€™s goals for a greener and more digital future.
