## About PGTEC

Following the terrible consequences of the 2024 DANA floods in the province of Valencia, PGTEC aims to develop a platform for climate emergency prevention and management, providing advanced tools for the collection, analysis and modelling of environmental and climate data. This solution is integrated into interoperable data spaces, allowing public administrations, emergency management agencies and companies in the climate sector to access real-time information for decision-making.

This project is part of the call for sectoral data spaces from the Data Space Reference Centre (CRED), under the Ministry for Digital Transformation and Public Administration, within the products and services programme.

### Platform
The platform will contribute to the **digitalization** of the climate resilience and emergency management sector, fostering the creation of **data-driven products** and **services** aligned with the principles of the **European Data Strategy** and the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan.

### Beneficiary sectors
- Emergency management and civil protection
- Environment and climate change  
- Public administration and smart cities 
- Mobility and logistics

### Technologies

- APIs: Various types of public and private APIs are used to collect data from different climate agencies, as well as proprietary REST APIs designed specifically for the project.

- Digital Twins: Different participants in the data space contribute hydrological, hydraulic and fire models to be fed with data and provide vital predictions for the prevention of climate emergencies. Other participants contribute dashboards or interactive maps to simulate real and future weather scenarios, such as IIAMA's [Water4Cast](https://water4cast.webs.upv.es/).

- **Smart Data Models:** Data schemas used to create a common ontology to standardise all data in the data space following the JSON-LD format.

- **Data Spaces:** Following the developments of Fiware for data spaces, the aim of the project is to implement a trusted, interoperable and federated data space that adds value to citizens and the government when making data-based decisions in the event of a climate emergency. Notable developments include the Trust Anchor component, which acts as a police force within the data space to ensure the trust and security of participants.

- **Verifiable Credentials:** Verifiable credentials that comply with European standards and the [EUDI European wallet](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/spaces/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/pages/694487738/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) are used for storage to ensure total security in the data space. Each participant will have credentials with which to interact with the other participants. This ensures a reliable data space. 

- **Cloud Services:** The data space is designed to be in the cloud using Amazon Web Services. The project has the collaboration of the companies [Kanzo-Tech](https://kanzo.site/) and [Think-IT](https://think-it.io/) to carry out the migration to the cloud.

### Data sources

The project is designed to prevent national climate emergencies, so the climate agencies of interest will be those that have national information. In addition, following the consequences of the DANA explained above, considerable emphasis has been placed on climate agencies in the Valencian Community. Therefore, the national climate agencies that provide data for the project are:

- [Agencia Estatal de Meteoroloǵia (AEMET)](https://www.aemet.es/es/portada)
- [Sistema de Información Agrocmlimática para el Regadío (SiAR)](https://servicio.mapa.gob.es/websiar/)
- [Confedereación Hidrográfica del Júcar (CHJ)](https://www.chj.es/es-es/Paginas/Home.aspx)
- [Agencia Valenciana de Meteorología (AVAMET)](https://www.avamet.org/mxo-meteoxarxaonline.html)

On the other hand, the international climate agencies that have been used for the development of the project are as follows:

- [Copernicus Climate Change & Emergency](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/copernicus-services/climate-change)
- [Canadian Meteorological Centre (MSC)](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servicio_meteorol%C3%B3gico_de_Canad%C3%A1)
- [German Meteorological Centre (Deutscher Wetterdienst - DWD)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html)
- [MeteoFrance](https://meteofrance.com/)
- [Europe Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about)
- [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/)
