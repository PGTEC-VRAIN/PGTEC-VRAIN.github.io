# AVSRE
The Valencian Agency for Security and Emergency Response (AVSRE) is the body of the Valencian Regional Government responsible for directing and managing civil protection, emergency management, firefighting and public safety in the Valencian Community. Its main function is to coordinate the various emergency services and ensure a rapid and effective response to any type of incident, including those of climatic origin. 

As a coordinating body, the AVSRE centralises a large amount of critical information for emergency management. This information comes from the following sources:

- Calls to the 112 emergency telephone number: records of incidents reported by the public.

- First responders: police, fire brigade, health services, etc. 

- Meteorological agencies: data and alerts from the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) and the Valencian Cartographic Institute (ICV). 

- Hydrographic confederations: information on the state of rivers and reservoirs. 

- Firefighting consortia and civil protection units. 

The AVSRE processes this information to generate **alerts**, coordinate the mobilisation of resources and provide up-to-date information to the public and the authorities.  

The quality of the data managed by the AVSRE is considered high in terms of reliability and official status, as it is the body that centralises and verifies the information from all the agencies involved in an em
 
## API

The AVSRE publishes institutional information, plans and notices, but the operational data needed for flood management usually comes from various connected providers (AEMET, Hydrographic Confederations, local councils, local sensor networks). 

The Regional Government maintains an open data catalogue (GVA Oberta / data portal) where data sets and REST APIs are published for many regional and municipal services; the AVSRE consumes and coordinates these flows in its operation.
