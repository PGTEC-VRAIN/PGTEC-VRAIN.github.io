# CEDEX
CEDEX is the centre for public works studies and experimentation. It is a cutting-edge public body in the field of public works, mobility, inland and marine waters, the environment and climate change. It is attached to the **Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility**, which also reports to the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge.  

CEDEX is divided into eight specialised technical units called Centres and Laboratories. From each centre, CEDEX provides high-level technical assistance, carries out applied research and technological development, and transfers knowledge through courses, conferences and seminars. Of the eight centres, the Centre for Hydrographic Studies stands out, providing the climate data necessary for this project. 

Its functions include the evaluation and certification of materials and techniques, the development of standards and regulations, and the promotion of R&D&I projects in line with national and European plans. In addition, it provides specialised technical assistance to administrations and private entities, collaborates in the conservation of infrastructure heritage, and promotes knowledge transfer through publications, courses and technical meetings. It also promotes national and international cooperation in the scientific-technical field and, in certain cases, acts as an arbitrator in disputes related to its area of competence. 
 
## API
CEDEX has a large amount of data available on its website. As such, it does not have an API for accessing the data. The data is fully accessible from the website itself.  

Among the available data, CEDEX presents eight different databases, each covering a different area of those described above. The databases are as follows: 

- Environmental Restoration Portal 

- Capacity Yearbook 

- Noise Mapping System 

- Coast and Sea Information System (INFOMAR) 

- Spanish Precipitation Isotope Monitoring Network (REVIP) 

- Spanish Water Information System (Hispagua) 

- Catalogue of waste materials that can be used in construction 

The database of interest for the project is the **Flow Measurement Yearbook**. This database is an official publication that compiles daily, monthly and annual data on flow rates measured at river and reservoir gauging stations. 

It includes hydrological records such as: 

- Average daily, monthly and annual flow rates. 

- Precipitation and inflows in the basins.

- Information on the measuring stations (location, technical characteristics, etc.).

- Evapotranspiration data such as temperature and precipitation. 

The data files are divided by each basin organisation. Among them is the **Júcar Hydrographic Conference (CHJ)**, which has all the data on the reservoirs and the Júcar River, which is the basin of interest for the project. 

The **update times** are not defined on the website. The time range covered by the data is from the last century to a **few years ago**. Depending on the dataset downloaded, the time span is different. For example, for the CHJ data, specifically the daily data files on reservoirs, canals, rivers and evaporation, the time span is different.

??? info "More information"
    Access to CEDEX data is direct. No API is provided for requesting data. Therefore, data can be downloaded directly from the databases and  [information portals section](https://www.cedex.es/bases-de-datos-y-portales-de-informacion) of the [CEDEX website](https://www.cedex.es/).  

    The databases and information portals page contains eight different databases, each covering a different subject area. The database of interest for the project is the [Yearbook of Gauging Stations](https://ceh.cedex.es/anuarioaforos/demarcaciones.asp). It contains different web links depending on the basin organisation of interest. The basin organisations correspond to the different rivers in Spain. 

    Once you have accessed the basin organisation of interest, in this case the Júcar basin, a new window opens with a list of links to different data sets in ‘csv’ format. To understand the different data sets, CEDEX has created a pdf file called [Descripción_Tablas_Júcar](https://ceh.cedex.es/anuarioaforos/anuario-2020-2021/JUCAR/Descripci%C3%B3n_def_Tablas.pdf ) which describes each of them and defines the fields and units. Finally, the data file can be downloaded immediately after clicking on the link.   -->
